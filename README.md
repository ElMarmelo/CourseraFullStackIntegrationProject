### How did Microsoft Copilot assist me?

Considering how low the bar was with this specific project, I leveraged it in order to make sure that I ended up having a solid foundation for any future project, this can be seen in the integration of stuff like a proper API Client with data services inside of the client project, as well as the proper setup of the server project with CORS and Output Caching. Which while isn't impressive by any means in my opinion, it did help me to get a good understanding of the concepts behind building a full stack application, as well as the proper use of Microsoft's tools for doing so, this can be seen in stuff like the shared models for the product information too.

I personally wish courses like this one aren't as redundant, most of the information seen in this one was a sort of repetition of what we've already studied in past courses of the certificate program, it is okay to have reminders but I found this particular course a little too repetitive for my enjoyment.

Some information was quite useful though, specially the one regarding SignalR, caching services and cancellation token sources, I hope we're able to build more stuff using those techniques in a future course and not just them being a one off.
